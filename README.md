#Web Audio API Examples

This is the source code to accompany a presentation, tutorial or article about the Web Audio API.

The source should be fairly self-explanatory but just ask if you want any pointers.

 - `code.js`
   - This is mostly housekeeping code to make the examples work
 - `graphs.js`
   - This is a collection of Audio Graphs illustrating different combinations
   
Feel free to add more examples, change how the demo page works or add more comments.
